Today it’s our pleasure to sit down with Jennifer Sloan of Scott Felder Homes so you can learn what she brings to the table as a home sales counselor and why we love working with people like her.&nbsp;

Jennifer has an MBA degree with a minor in psychology. She worked with a custom builder before joining Scott Felder Homes, so she has an extensive background in showing homes, which has given her a wealth of knowledge in terms of helping buyers design their own homes.&nbsp;

Jennifer has been with Scott Felder homes for a little less than a year. She actually wanted to work with them before she started last November (and they even tried hiring her a couple times), but the timing wasn’t quite right.&nbsp;

Now that she’s taken the leap, she absolutely loves their home designs—especially their finish-outs. **She describes Scott Felder Homes as both buyer friendly and employee friendly.** She likes to have fun at her job, and it’s important that her buyers enjoy themselves and are taken care of, and she knows those things are a given at Scott Felder Homes. They’re also routinely recognized for their up-to-date floor plans, so she knows her clients will always find a floor plan they love.&nbsp;

Joining Scott Felder Homes was very much a “labor of love” for Jennifer, meaning she doesn’t just sell a product—she genuinely loves what she sells. For example, the home we’re at in the video above sits inside the Foxbrook neighborhood, which features a lot of green space and beautiful views. Additionally, it has a nice amenity center, community center, a playground/park, and many walking trails.&nbsp;

**Jennifer is exactly the kind of person we love working with here at the Hammonds Group,** and if you buy a home from Scott Felder Homes, you’ll love working with her too.&nbsp;
