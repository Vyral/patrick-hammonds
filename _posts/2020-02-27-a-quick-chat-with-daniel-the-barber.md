  I like to look good, and that includes getting a regular haircut from my man
  Daniel the barber. On my latest visit, I brought a camera so you could see how
  good he is at his job.

Today I’m joined by a very special guest, Daniel the Barber. I’m a big tan of taking care of myself. I think that if you look good and you feel good, everything else is good too. Today I’m getting my regular haircut, and I wanted to show you how the process looks. It’s pretty simple, but I always feel so much better afterward.

Daniel started cutting his own hair in high school. Then, he started cutting friends’ hair in high school and later, in the military as well. When he came back to civilian life, he wasn’t sure what path his career would take. **His initial thought was to go to culinary school, but he changed his mind at the last minute and enrolled in barber school.**

Daniel isn’t just a barber; he’s also an artist. **In the video above, you can see some of the custom hair brushes he’s made with Nintendo and Disney characters, which are available for purchase.** They’re really amazing.

**Starting at 2:40 in the video above, you can see Daniel in action as he cuts my hair.** If you want to get in touch with Daniel to schedule your own appointment, send him a text to (210) 995-6614 or visit him on Instagram @spaten02.

If you have any real estate-related questions for me or needs that I can assist with, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I would love to hear from you.
